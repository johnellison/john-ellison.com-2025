## THE CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME

We are living through a convergence of crises.

Climate change and biodiversity collapse are accelerating.
Social trust is fragmenting.
Inequality is widening.

And AI is accelerating all of it.

**AI is not neutral.**

Extraction or regeneration — it comes down to **intention**.

## TRANSITION

This moment calls for leaders who can BUILD while holding complexity and emotional tension — who understand technology, human behavior, and the systems we live in...

That's where my work sits.

---

## PROFESSIONAL SNAPSHOT

Over the past 16 years, I've worked across startups, social enterprises, and global organizations in healthcare, civic tech, climate, crypto, and insurtech.

**A quick overview:**
- 300+ founders
- $18M+ raised
- Multiple acquisitions
- Teams from seed stage to Series A and beyond

I'm certified through Dr. BJ Fogg's Behavior Design Lab (Stanford), trained with Jake Knapp of Google Ventures and bring a behavioral science lens into product, culture, and AI adoption work.

What I'm known for isn't speed alone — it's helping teams build fast without breaking trust.

## WHAT I ACTUALLY DO

### AI & Product Systems

I design and prototype AI-powered tools that help teams think, decide, and work better — often in days, not months.

**This includes:**
- AI knowledge hubs & decision support tools
- Internal tools for product, ops, and leadership teams
- Rapid prototyping using modern AI workflows ("vibe-coding")

---

### Behavior, Trust & Culture

Most AI transformations fail quietly — through erosion of trust, clarity, and agency.

**I help organizations:**
- Introduce AI without destabilizing culture
- Design for real behavior change, not compliance
- Maintain psychological safety during transformation

---

### Regenerative & Mission-Driven Innovation

My work is grounded in regeneration — ecological, social, and human.

**I've built and supported:**
- Climate and regenerative finance ecosystems
- Community-led innovation networks
- Products and organizations aligned with long-term planetary health

---

## HUMAN CONTEXT

Outside of work, I'm a father of two.

I've lived and worked across the US, UK, Portugal, Morocco, and Tunisia, often in community settings. Those experiences shaped how I think about systems, land, belonging, and responsibility.

I surf, play guitar, care deeply about land and lineage, and believe that how we build reflects who we are — whether we name it or not.

## EXPRESSION

This work has taken many forms:
- Music, released as John Dass
- Film, including a pilgrimage documentary
- Writing & community, through ReFi DAO, ReFi Podcast, and Regenera
- Products & platforms, built inside real organizations under real constraints

Different mediums.
The same underlying questions.

*(These surface selectively throughout the site — not as a list.)*

## HOW TO READ THIS SITE

You won't find everything at once.

This site is designed to reveal itself gradually — through structure, interaction, and choice — much like the work it represents.

If something resonates, you'll know where to go next.

---

## INVITATION

I work best with founders, leaders, and teams navigating complexity — especially where technology, culture, and values collide.

**If you're exploring:**
- AI adoption without losing your people
- Product or organizational inflection points
- Regenerative or mission-driven innovation

Then this is a good place to start.

**CTA:** Work with me
*(or simply stay and explore)*
