## Contact Prioritization Workflow

### Step 1: Segment Your Lists

**TwentyCRM (2,700 Contacts):**
1. Export to CSV
2. Filter by:
   - Title (CEO, CFO, COO, VP Ops, Head of Product, Head of Growth)
   - Company Size (10-200 employees)
   - Industry (Tech-enabled, SaaS, Professional Services, Healthcare, Insurance)
3. Tag with relationship strength:
   - `Tier1-Hot` = Worked together, mutual contact, recent conversation
   - `Tier2-Warm` = LinkedIn connection, past event, subscriber
   - `Tier3-Cold` = No prior relationship

**ReFi DAO List (4,000 Subscribers):**
1. Filter out personal emails (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail)
2. Filter by email domain to identify founders/operators
3. Cross-reference with LinkedIn to find decision-makers
4. Tag as `Tier3-Cold` unless you have prior relationship

**LinkedIn Contacts:**
1. Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator or manual search:
   - Title: CEO, COO, CFO, VP Operations, Head of Product
   - Company Size: 11-200 employees
   - Industry: SaaS, Tech, Professional Services
   - Geography: [Your target markets]
2. Check for recent activity (posts about AI, funding announcements, new roles)
3. Tag based on relationship strength

### Step 2: Build Your Daily Hit List

**Daily Target: 10-20 Outreach Messages**

**Prioritize:**
1. 5 Tier 1 (Hot Leads) → Personalized warm outreach
2. 10 Tier 2 (Warm Leads) → Warm outreach with value-add
3. 5 Tier 3 (Cold Leads) → Cold outreach, volume play

**Tools:**
- Spreadsheet (Google Sheets) with columns:
  - Name
  - Company
  - Title
  - Email
  - LinkedIn URL
  - Tier (1-4)
  - Outreach Date
  - Template Used
  - Response (Y/N)
  - Next Step
  - Status (Cold, Active, Nurture, Won, Closed)

---

### Step 3: Research Before Outreach (5 Minutes Per Contact)

**For Tier 1 (Hot):**
- Review recent LinkedIn activity
- Check company news (funding, new product, leadership changes)
- Refresh your memory on past interactions
- Identify specific pain point or hook

**For Tier 2 (Warm):**
- Review LinkedIn profile
- Check company website for AI mentions
- Note shared connections or communities

**For Tier 3 (Cold):**
- Quick LinkedIn scan
- Company website (30 seconds)
- Note: Is this a good fit? (ICP check)

**Pro Tip:**  
If research reveals they're not a fit, move to Tier 4 (Ignore) immediately. Don't waste time on bad leads.

---

### Step 4: Send Outreach

**Batch Your Outreach:**
- **Morning Block (9-10 AM):** Send 10 messages (5 Tier 1, 5 Tier 2)
- **Afternoon Block (2-3 PM):** Send 10 messages (5 Tier 2, 5 Tier 3)

**Log Immediately:**
- After each message, log in CRM or spreadsheet
- Set reminder for follow-up (Day 2, Day 5, Day 10)

**Channel Strategy:**
- **Tier 1:** LinkedIn DM or Email (whichever is warmer)
- **Tier 2:** LinkedIn DM first, Email on Day 2 if no response
- **Tier 3:** Email (cold outreach template)

## Making It Less Painful (Your Specific Challenge)

You mentioned: _"I tend to find it difficult to sit on the computer, scrolling through socials and reaching out to people."_

### Solution 1: Batch & Time-Box
- **Don't scroll.** Use lists.
- Pre-build your daily hit list the night before (15 min)
- Time-box outreach: 30 min morning, 30 min afternoon
- Set a timer. When it's done, you're done.

### Solution 2: Gamify It
- Track streak: "10 messages sent for 5 days straight"
- Reward milestones: "Sent 100 messages → take afternoon off"
- Compete with yourself: "Beat last week's response rate"

### Solution 3: Accountability Partner
- Share daily metrics with someone (partner, friend, coach)
- Text them your numbers at end of day
- Public commitment = higher follow-through

### Solution 4: Automate the Boring Parts
- Use templates (already built in this system)
- Use CRM to auto-set follow-up reminders
- Use LinkedIn to auto-suggest leads (Sales Navigator)

### Solution 5: Make It a Ritual
- **Morning Coffee = Outreach Time**
- Same time, same place, same duration
- Build the habit until it's automatic
