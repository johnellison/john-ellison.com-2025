## Warm Outreach Template

### LinkedIn DM (Existing Connection)

**Subject/Opening:**
"Quick question about [Company Name]'s AI roadmap"

**Body:**
Hey [First Name],

Hope you're doing well. I've been thinking about our conversation on [specific topic] and wanted to reach out.

I'm working on something I think could be relevant to [Company Name]. We're helping Series A-C companies move from AI experimentation to *deployed systems* in 4-8 weeks—not pilots, actual production code.

The clients we work with tend to be stuck in one of three places:
1. Board pressure to "do something with AI" but no clear strategy
2. Pilot projects that never make it to production
3. Internal resistance from teams who don't see the ROI

Does any of that resonate?

If so, I'd love to send over our free 8-minute readiness assessment. It'll give you a score across 6 dimensions (leadership, data, tech, talent, governance, culture) and show you exactly where the blockers are.

No sales call required—just actionable data.

Let me know if you're curious.

Best,  
John

### Email (Warm Contact from Pikl/Regenera/Substack)

**Subject Line:**
"[First Name], quick thought on AI + [Company/Industry]"

**Body:**
Hey [First Name],

It's been a minute! I wanted to reach out because I've been working on something at the intersection of AI transformation and organizational psychology that I think could be relevant to [Company Name / Industry].

**The short version:**  
Most companies are stuck in the "AI pilot purgatory"—using ChatGPT ad hoc or running experiments that never ship. We help teams move from curiosity to deployed systems in 4-8 weeks by addressing the organizational blockers (data, governance, culture) *alongside* the tech.

**Why I'm reaching out:**  
I know [Company/Industry] is at an inflection point with AI, and based on [specific detail—newsletter topic, LinkedIn post, mutual contact], it feels like this could be timely.

Would love to catch up for 15 minutes and share what we're seeing in the market. No pitch—just a conversation.

Let me know if you're open.

Best,  
John

**P.S.** If you're curious, here's our free assessment: [link]. Takes 8 minutes and gives you a readiness score. Worth checking out even if we don't chat.

**Follow-Up Message (After Connection Accepted):**

Hey [First Name],

Thanks for connecting! I'll keep this short.

I help companies like [Company Name] move from AI experimentation to *deployed systems* in 4-8 weeks—not decks, not pilots, actual production code.

We work with Series A-C teams who are feeling one (or all) of these:
- Board pressure to show AI ROI but unclear where to start
- Stuck in pilot purgatory—experiments that never ship
- Internal resistance from teams who don't trust AI or see the value

If any of that resonates, I'd love to send you our 8-minute readiness assessment. It scores you across 6 dimensions (leadership, data, tech, talent, governance, culture) and flags your blockers.

Worth 8 minutes of your time?

### Email (Cold, Targeted)

**Subject Line (Pick One):**
- "Stop treating AI like a tool. Start shipping it."
- "[First Name], your AI pilots aren't shipping—here's why"
- "94% of AI projects fail. Here's how to be in the 6%."

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out because I think [Company Name] is at a critical AI inflection point.

**Here's what I'm seeing in the market:**  
94% of AI implementations fail to deliver ROI. The reason? Companies bolt AI onto broken processes instead of redesigning workflows for human-AI collaboration.

**The companies that succeed do three things:**
1. Quantify their readiness (data, governance, culture) *before* they build
2. Ship production code in 4-8 weeks instead of running endless pilots
3. Build *with* their teams, not *for* them, so the knowledge stays internal

**Why I'm reaching out:**  
We help Series A-C companies ($1M-$50M revenue, 10-200 employees) move from AI curiosity to deployed systems in 4-8 weeks. Our clients include [Industry A], [Industry B], and [Industry C] teams moving faster than their competitors.

**Would it make sense to explore?**

If you're open, I'd love to send you our free 8-minute assessment. It'll score your organization across 6 readiness dimensions and show you where the blockers are.

Let me know.
