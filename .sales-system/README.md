## Making It Stick (Addressing Your Challenge)

You mentioned finding it difficult to sit and scroll through socials. This system is designed to solve that:

### 1. No Scrolling
- Pre-build hit lists (10-20 contacts)
- Open → Execute → Close
- Never browse or scroll

### 2. Time-Boxed
- 30-minute blocks (not open-ended)
- Clear start and end time
- 90 min/day total

### 3. Tiny Habits
- Start with 1 message after morning coffee
- Build to 10, then 20
- Momentum > willpower

### 4. Accountability
- Track daily streak
- Text friend your count at 6pm
- Public commitment

### 5. Gamification
- Points for messages, responses, calls
- Levels and rewards
- Make it fun, not a grind

**See [09-psychological-hacks.md](./09-psychological-hacks.md) for the full playbook.**

## Success Formula

```
30 minutes of focus/day
→ 10 messages sent
→ 2 responses
→ 1 call/week
→ 1 deal/month
→ $35k-$70k revenue
```

**That's it. That's the whole game.**

---

## Support & Questions

If you get stuck:
1. Review the relevant document
2. Simplify: Cut daily target to 10 messages instead of 20
3. Ask for help: Reach out to accountability partner or coach

**Remember:** Consistency beats perfection. 10 messages/day for 5 days = 50 messages = 10 responses = 5 calls. That's enough to close 1 deal/month.
