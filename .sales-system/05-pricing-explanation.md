## How to Present Pricing

### Frame 1: Value, Not Cost

**Wrong Way:**
"Phase 1 costs $15,000."

**Right Way:**
"Phase 1 is a $15,000 investment that compresses 6 months of trial-and-error into 2 weeks. It identifies the exact blockers preventing AI adoption—data silos, governance gaps, cultural resistance—so you don't waste $200k building something no one uses."

**Key Insight:**  
Always anchor pricing to *ROI* and *time saved*, not just the deliverable.

---

### Frame 2: Comparison to Alternatives

**Big Consulting (McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte):**
- **Cost:** $500k - $2M+
- **Timeline:** 6-12 months
- **Deliverable:** 60-page strategy deck
- **Code Shipped:** None

**Your Offering:**
- **Cost:** $35k - $70k
- **Timeline:** 4-8 weeks
- **Deliverable:** Production-ready AI tools + codebase + documentation
- **Code Shipped:** Yes

**Positioning:**
"You're getting 10x the value at 1/10th the cost."

---

### Frame 3: ROI Justification

**Phase 1 ROI:**
- **Problem:** Companies that skip readiness assessments are 4x more likely to fail within 6 months.
- **Solution:** Phase 1 identifies blockers and prioritizes the right build, saving $200k+ in wasted pilot spend.
- **Payback:** If we prevent even one failed pilot, Phase 1 pays for itself 10x over.

**Phase 2 ROI:**
- **Problem:** Operational inefficiencies cost $12.9M/year on average (data quality alone).
- **Solution:** An AI tool that saves 15 hours/week = $[X]/month in labor costs.
- **Payback:** If the tool saves 15 hours/week @ $100/hour, that's $6,000/month = $72,000/year. Phase 2 pays for itself in under 1 month.

**Total ROI Example:**
- **Cost:** $50,000 (Phase 1 + Phase 2)
- **Savings (Year 1):** $72,000 (efficiency) + $50,000 (avoided pilot failure) = $122,000
- **Net Gain:** $72,000 in Year 1
- **Payback Period:** <1 month

## Pricing Tiers: When to Use Low, Mid, High

### Low End ($10k Phase 1, $25k Phase 2 = $35k Total)

**When to Use:**
- Small companies ($1M-$10M revenue, 10-50 employees)
- Single, well-defined use case
- High data readiness (low remediation work)
- Short sprint (2 weeks)

**Example:**
"You're a Series A company with 30 employees. Your data is clean, your team is aligned, and you have one clear use case: automating proposal generation. This is a $35k engagement."

---

### Mid Range ($15k Phase 1, $35k Phase 2 = $50k Total)

**When to Use:**
- Mid-sized companies ($10M-$50M revenue, 50-150 employees)
- 1-2 use cases with moderate complexity
- Some data remediation needed
- 3-4 week sprint

**Example:**
"You're Series B, 100 employees, with moderate data silos. We'll need to centralize CRM + email data, which adds some complexity. This is closer to $50k."

---

### High End ($20k Phase 1, $50k Phase 2 = $70k Total)

**When to Use:**
- Larger companies ($50M+ revenue, 150-200 employees)
- 2+ use cases or high technical complexity
- Significant data remediation or governance work
- 4-week sprint with multiple stakeholders

**Example:**
"You're Series C, 200 employees, with legacy systems and significant compliance requirements. We'll need to build governance frameworks and integrate multiple data sources. This is a $70k engagement."

---

## How to Handle Pricing Objections

### Objection 1: "That's expensive"

**Response:**
"I hear you. Let's talk ROI. What does it cost you right now to *not* have this problem solved?"

**Example:**
- "If your ops team spends 15 hours/week on manual work that AI could do, that's $6,000/month wasted."
- "If you build a pilot without a readiness diagnostic and it fails, that's $200k down the drain."
- "The real cost isn't the $50k investment—it's the $500k you'd spend with a big consulting firm for a deck you can't use."

**Reframe:**
"Think of this as insurance against wasted spend. We're de-risking your AI strategy."

---

### Objection 2: "Can we get a discount?"

**Response (Option A: Hold Firm):**
"I price based on value, not discounts. If we save you $200k by preventing a failed pilot, is $15k for Phase 1 expensive? Let's focus on the ROI."

**Response (Option B: Conditional Discount):**
"I can offer a 10% discount if you commit to both Phases upfront and pay 100% upon signing. That brings the total to $[X]. Sound fair?"

**Pro Tip:**  
Never discount without getting something in return (faster payment, case study rights, referral agreement).

---

### Objection 3: "We need to think about it"

**Response:**
"Totally fair—this is a significant decision. What specific part do you need to think through? Is it budget, timing, or the scope?"

**Uncover the Real Objection:**
- **Budget:** "Do you have budget allocated, or is this discretionary?"
- **Timing:** "When were you planning to move on this? Next quarter?"
- **Scope:** "Does the roadmap feel unclear, or do you need more detail on Phase 2?"

**Close:**
"Let's address that now so you have everything you need to make a decision."

---

### Objection 4: "Can we just do Phase 1 and decide later?"

**Response:**
"Absolutely. Phase 1 is standalone. You'll walk away with a readiness score, governance framework, and prioritized roadmap. If you decide not to move to Phase 2, you can execute internally or with another partner."

**Positioning:**
"That said, 80% of clients who complete Phase 1 move to Phase 2 because the ROI is so clear. But there's zero obligation."

---

### Objection 5: "We're comparing you to [other vendor]"

**Response:**
"Smart move—you should compare. Here are the questions I'd ask them:

1. **Do they ship production code, or just prototypes?**
2. **Do they build *with* your team, or *for* you?** (Knowledge transfer matters.)
3. **Do they assess readiness first, or jump straight to building?** (Skipping diagnostics = high failure rate.)
4. **Are they vendor-neutral, or tied to a specific AI stack?**

If they check all those boxes, they're a great option. If not, that's where we differentiate."

---

## Pricing Positioning Scripts

### Script 1: Value-First

"The investment is $50,000 for Phases 1 and 2. Here's what that gets you:
- You avoid the $200k mistake of building on a broken foundation
- You ship a production-ready AI tool that saves $6,000/month in labor costs
- You compress 6 months of trial-and-error into 4 weeks
- Your team learns the methodology and can keep building after we leave

The ROI is clear: $50,000 investment, $72,000/year in savings. You're net positive in under a month."

---

### Script 2: Comparison-First

"You have three options:

1. **Big Consulting:** $500k-$2M, 6-12 months, you get a deck, no code.
2. **Build Internally:** $0 upfront, but 6-12 months of trial-and-error, high failure risk.
3. **Work With Us:** $50k, 4-8 weeks, you get production code, governance, and knowledge transfer.

Which path makes the most sense for [Company Name]?"

---

### Script 3: ROI-First

"Let me ask: what does it cost your team to spend 15 hours/week on [manual process]?

At $100/hour, that's $6,000/month, or $72,000/year.

If we ship an AI tool that automates that process, you're saving $72,000 annually. The investment is $50,000. You're net positive in under a month.

Does that math work for you?"

---

## Pricing Decision Tree

```
Does the client have budget allocated?
 ├─ YES → Present pricing, frame as ROI
 └─ NO → Ask: "What would it take to get budget approved?"

Is the client comparing vendors?
 ├─ YES → Differentiate on code, speed, knowledge transfer
 └─ NO → Focus on ROI and urgency

Is the client hesitant about price?
 ├─ YES → Uncover real objection (budget, timing, scope)
 └─ NO → Close with next steps (contract, payment)
```

---

## Discount Strategy (Use Sparingly)

### When to Offer Discounts
- **Conditional Discount (10%):** If client commits to both phases upfront and pays 100% upon signing
- **Referral Discount (5-10%):** If client agrees to be a case study or provide 2+ qualified referrals
- **Multi-Engagement Discount (15%):** If client commits to 3+ sprints over 6 months

### When NOT to Discount
- Early in the sales process (don't anchor price low)
- If the client is already enthusiastic (they'll pay full price)
- If you're differentiated (you're not competing on price)

**Pro Tip:**  
Frame discounts as *strategic partnerships*, not desperation. "If you're willing to be a case study and provide 2 referrals, I can offer 10% off as a partnership investment."

---

## Payment Terms Strategy

### Standard Terms
- **Phase 1:** 50% upfront, 50% on delivery
- **Phase 2:** 50% upfront, 50% on deployment

### Preferred Terms (Incentivized)
- **100% upfront for both phases:** 10% discount
- **Net-30:** No discount (use for established relationships only)

**Why This Matters:**
Cash flow. Getting 50%+ upfront de-risks the project and ensures commitment.
