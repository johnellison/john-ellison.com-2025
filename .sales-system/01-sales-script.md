## Discovery Call Framework (60-Minute Structure)

### Opening (5 minutes)
**Goal**: Build immediate rapport and set expectations

"Thanks for making time today. Before we dive in, let me share what I do and what success looks like from calls like this:

I help organizations move from AI curiosity to deployed systems in 4-8 weeks. Most companies are stuck in pilot phase because they're bolting AI onto broken processes. We assess readiness, then ship real production code—not decks. And your team learns methodology to keep building after we leave.

To make sure this conversation is valuable for you, I'd love to understand your current state. I'll ask a few questions—no pressure to buy anything at the end. Sound fair?"

### Situation Assessment (20 minutes)

**Current State:**

1. **"Walk me through your organization's current relationship with AI."**
   - *Listen for*: Ad hoc ChatGPT use, formal programs, stuck pilots, nothing at all
   - *Signal to note*: Specific tools mentioned (OpenAI, Anthropic, in-house)

2. **"What's the last AI-related decision your leadership team discussed?"**
   - *Listen for*: Alignment, skepticism, budget, urgency
   - *Signal*: "We're exploring" vs. "We need to ship" vs. "We're waiting"

3. **"Are you running any pilots? If so, what's preventing them from advancing to production?"**
   - *Listen for*: Data issues, adoption problems, governance blocks, unclear ROI

4. **"What triggered this conversation today? What problem are you trying to solve?"**
   - *Listen for*: Board pressure, competitor moves, efficiency gaps, FOMO, revenue opportunities
   - *Score urgency*: 1-10 based on specificity and timeline mentioned

5. **"If you don't solve this problem in the next 6 months, what's the impact?"**
   - *Listen for*: Quantified cost, competitive disadvantage, missed opportunities
   - *Key phrase*: "That's exactly why I called" (builds rapport)

6. **"On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you your current approach will deliver measurable ROI within 6-12 months?"**
   - *Listen for*: Honesty, uncertainty, overconfidence
   - *Action*: If <7, probe deeper on what's blocking

**Blockers & Readiness:**

7. **"What's preventing you from moving faster with AI right now?"**
   - *Listen for*: Data silos, talent gaps, cultural resistance, unclear strategy, budget constraints
   - *Map to readiness dimension*: Data, Talent, Governance, Strategy

8. **"How would you describe your data environment—is it clean and accessible, or siloed and inconsistent?"**
   - *Listen for*: Data warehouse, Excel everywhere, no lineage, quality issues
   - *Signal*: This is readiness score #1 indicator

9. **"Are your technical teams excited about AI, or skeptical?"**
   - *Listen for*: Internal champions vs. resistance, skill gaps
   - *Action*: If skeptical, ask "What would help them get excited?"

### Qualification (MEDDIC) (10 minutes)

**M - Metrics:**

10. **"How do you measure success for AI initiatives? What KPIs matter most to you?"**
    - *Listen for*: Productivity gains, cost reduction, revenue impact, adoption rate
    - *Validate*: Are these realistic? Do they have baselines?

**E - Economic Buyer:**

11. **"Who controls the budget for AI initiatives? Who makes final go/no-go decisions?"**
    - *Listen for*: CEO, CFO, VP of Engineering, Board approval process
    - *Signal*: Single decision-maker vs. committee

**D - Decision Criteria:**

12. **"What factors will you evaluate when choosing an AI partner? What's most important?"**
    - *Listen for*: Speed to value, governance expertise, pricing, methodology, technical capability
    - *Map to your value prop*: Emphasize matches

**D - Decision Process:**

13. **"What's your timeline for making a decision? What happens if this doesn't move in 30-60 days?"**
    - *Listen for*: Urgency, budget windows, competitor pressure, board meetings
    - *Score*: High urgency = immediate next step

**I - Identify Pain:**

14. **"What's the single biggest frustration you've had with previous transformation initiatives?"**
    - *Listen for*: Consultants who didn't ship, tech that wasn't adopted, budget wasted, unclear ROI
    - *Validate*: Can you solve this pain?

**C - Champion:**

15. **"Who internally would be the champion to drive this forward if we move forward?"**
    - *Listen for*: Named person with authority and motivation
    - *Validate*: Are they in room? Will they fight for budget?

### Positioning & Education (15 minutes)

**Share Context:**

"The research is clear: 94% of AI implementations fail to deliver meaningful ROI. The 6% that succeed share three patterns:

1. They don't bolt AI onto broken processes—they redesign workflows end-to-end
2. They treat it as 85% organizational change problem, not 15% tech project
3. They ship production code in weeks, not months of pilots

**Differentiation:**

"Here's what's different about working with us:

- **We ship code, not decks**: Phase 1 gives you a roadmap, Phase 2 builds production tools in 4 weeks
- **Your team learns methodology**: We build WITH your engineers, transfer knowledge, so they keep shipping after we leave
- **We assess readiness first**: No point building on a foundation that can't support adoption
- **Dual expertise**: I bring 16 years of startup growth; Fatma brings organizational psychology from Snapchat, Google, WEF"

**Two Offerings Clarification:**

"I work with two types of clients:

1. **AI Transformation (B2B companies)**: For organizations $1M-$50M revenue, 10-200 employees who want to deploy AI across the business
2. **Executive AI Transformation (Individual)**: For founders and executives who want to reclaim 14+ hours weekly with personalized AI workflows

**Which resonates more with your situation today?""

### Budget & Pricing Expectations (10 minutes)

16. **"What's your budget range for this type of initiative?"**
    - *Listen for*: <$10k, $10k-$25k, $25k-$50k, $50k-$100k, $100k+
    - *Action*: If <$10k, explain value gap; if $25k-$50k, you're in sweet spot

17. **"How do you typically evaluate consulting partners—project-based, retainer, or outcome-based?"**
    - *Listen for*: Preference and past experience
    - *Signal*: This informs proposal structure

### Close (10 minutes)

**If Qualified (High Readiness, Budget Aligned, Urgent):**

"Based on what you've shared, here's my recommendation:

We start with **Phase 1: AI Readiness & Strategy** ($10k-$20k, 1-2 weeks)

You'll get:
- Quantified readiness score across 6 dimensions
- Prioritized roadmap of 3-5 high-impact use cases
- Governance scaffolding (security, policy, accountability)
- Leadership alignment workshop

If your readiness score is high, we move directly to **Phase 2: AI Product Sprint** ($25k-$50k, 2-4 weeks)

We ship 1-2 production-ready AI tools integrated into your operations—not demos. Your team builds with us, learns methodology, takes ownership after.

**Does this sound like the right next step? If so, let's block 60 minutes next week for a Phase 1 workshop to kick off. I'll send a proposal before our call so we can dive straight into value.**"

**If Low Readiness:**

"I'd recommend we start with a complimentary assessment (8 minutes, free). It will give you a readiness score across the 6 dimensions so you know exactly where you stand—and what to fix before investing in pilots.

Most organizations discover their blockers in the assessment. Would 15 minutes next Tuesday work for that call?"

**If Not Qualified (No Budget, No Urgency):**

"Totally understand. AI initiatives are strategic and timing matters.

One resource: I wrote a whitepaper on why 80% of AI transformations fail and what the top 6% do differently. It includes a diagnostic you can run internally. Would you like me to send it over? No obligation—just helpful context if/when you revisit this."

---

## Objection Handling Framework

### "We already work with [McKinsey/BCG/Deloitte]"

**Response:**
"That's great—they're unmatched for strategy frameworks and governance. Here's the difference: they give you a 60-page deck. We give you functional code in 4 weeks.

They sell hours and reports. We ship products and transfer knowledge.

If you have a strategy nailed but need a partner to actually **build** and **deploy** with your team—that's where we come in.

What would a working AI product be worth to you vs. another strategic assessment?"

**If still pushing back:**
"Big consulting firms are the right choice for brand trust and board-level governance frameworks. But at $500k-$2M+, you're paying for prestige, not code.

We're the team you bring in when you're ready to ship—not just talk about shipping."

---

### "Can we skip Phase 1 and jump straight to building?"

**Response:**
"I get the urgency—everyone wants to ship. But here's why skipping assessment is 4x more likely to fail:

MIT research shows companies who skip readiness diagnostics:
- Pick wrong use cases (solve problems nobody cares about)
- Build on broken data foundations (data quality kills 52% of projects)
- Get blocked by compliance late in process (costing months of rework)

The assessment **compresses 6 months of trial-and-error into 2 weeks of structured clarity. The fastest path is the thoughtful one."

**Reframe:**
"Think of it like surgery: You don't skip the MRI because you're in a hurry. The MRI shows you exactly where to operate.

The assessment is your MRI—2 weeks, clarity on blockers, then we ship fast."

---

### "Our tech team can handle this internally"

**Response:**
"Your technical team is absolutely critical—and they'll be building alongside us in Phase 2. They know your systems better than anyone.

But here's reality from 300+ failed AI projects: **tech is only 15% of the equation**.

The other 85% that determines adoption:
- Data quality (52% cite this as #1 blocker)
- Talent alignment and skills
- Governance and compliance
- Change management and culture

Your engineers can build the models. But can they design the organizational change program so people actually **use** what they build?

We assess all 6 dimensions so your tech team isn't building on a foundation that can't support adoption."

**Data Hook:**
"MIT found 85% of AI failures are due to data quality—not code quality. Your team is great at code. Are they experts at data governance, lineage, and quality enforcement?"

---

### "AI is moving too fast—should we wait?"

**Response:**
"That's a trap I see organizations fall into—and it's costly.

Here's reality: The models are good enough now. The 8-month competitive window is real.

Companies that ship in the next 6 months gain:
- 5%+ EBIT impact (McKinsey data on high performers)
- 3-6 month advantage over competitors still at 'exploration'

In 12 months, the models will be better, but your competitors will have caught up. Your first-mover advantage evaporates.

The question isn't 'Is AI ready?' It's 'Are **you** ready to move while others hesitate?'"

---

### "What if technology changes in 6 months?"

**Response:**
"It will. That's guaranteed. But here's what doesn't change:

1. Clean, governed data architecture
2. Aligned leadership on strategy
3. Workflows designed for human-AI collaboration
4. Your team's capability to iterate and improve

We build vendor-neutral systems. You're not locked into a stack—you're building organizational fluency.

As models improve, your team swaps in new ones. The foundation we build in Phase 1 (data, governance, workflows) remains valid for 5+ years."

**Value Anchor:**
"What's the cost of waiting? If you deploy in 6 months vs. 18 months, what's the opportunity cost of those 12 months?"

---

### "This sounds expensive"

**Response:**
"Let's talk ROI with real numbers from our clients:

**Cost side:**
- Phase 1: $10k-$20k (readiness assessment + strategy)
- Phase 2: $25k-$50k (production code shipped)

**Value side:**
- Average company loses $12.9M annually due to poor data quality (IBM study)
- Early adopters see 14-74% productivity gains (Harvard research)
- Customer service AI: 14-34% productivity boost (MIT/Stanford)
- If we help you reclaim even 5% of that waste, Phase 1 pays for itself in first month

**Comparison:**
Alternative is $500k-$2M with big consulting firms for a deck you can't execute.

**Reframe:**
"The real cost isn't $35k-$70k. It's:
- $2M+ for a big consulting deck that sits on a shelf
- 12-18 months your competitors gain while you're stuck at 'exploring AI'
- Opportunity cost of delayed AI adoption

What's the ROI if you ship even 6 months faster?"

---

### "We're too small for this" (under $1M revenue or <10 employees)

**For AI Transformation (B2B):**
"You're actually in the perfect sweet spot. Here's why:

Companies <$100M move faster than enterprises (less red tape). You have more budget than pre-seed startups.

The risk: If you don't move now, a well-funded Series B competitor will. They'll learn on your customers, build AI before you, and change the economics of your market.

This is the window. Phase 1 for $10k gives you clarity on blockers. That's minimal risk for the upside of shipping months ahead."

**For Executive AI Transformation (Individual):**
"This is priced for executives and founders whose time is worth $300-$1000+/hour.

If you're reclaiming 14+ hours weekly at that bill rate, you're saving $8k-$40k monthly. The investment pays for itself in 1-2 weeks.

What's your time worth per hour?"

---

### "We're not sure what problem to solve first"

**Response:**
"That's exactly why Phase 1 exists. Here's what you're getting:

1. Readiness assessment across 6 dimensions (data, leadership, tech, talent, governance, use cases, culture)
2. Map of your highest-leverage opportunities
3. Prioritization based on Impact × Confidence ÷ Effort (ICE scoring)
4. Clear roadmap of which 3-5 use cases to build first

You won't get analysis paralysis. You'll get a prioritized action plan.

And here's the key: We validate with your end users before recommending builds. No guessing—real data from your team."

---

### "We need board approval / this is above my authority"

**Response:**
"Totally understand. I can help you build the business case for your board.

Here's what boards care about:
- ROI with specific numbers (not vague promises)
- Risk mitigation (what happens if we DON'T do this)
- Competitive risk (what happens if COMPETITORS do this and we don't)
- Clear milestones and deliverables

If you're open to it, I can create a 2-page board memo summarizing:
- The quantified business case
- Phased investment with clear stop/go gates
- Expected outcomes within 6 and 12 months

Would that help you get alignment internally?"

---
