# Follow-Up Cadence System

**Context**: Based on research showing 5-7 touches over 14 days with 80%+ response rates. This system minimizes pressure while staying top-of-mind.

---

## Core Principles

### Why This Works
- **80% of sales require 5+ follow-ups**: Don't stop after 1-2 no-responses
- **Vary the channel**: Mix email, LinkedIn, phone across touches
- **Add value each time**: Never "just checking in" without new information
- **Respect boundaries**: Give clear outs, don't chase indefinitely
- **Day 14 is final**: If no engagement by Day 14, move to nurture list

### Best Response Times
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: 10am-11am prospect's local time (highest response rates)
- **Avoid Monday mornings**: Inboxes are flooded; lowest engagement
- **Avoid Friday afternoons**: Weekends approaching; people mentally checked out

---

## Complete Cadence (14-Day Sequence)

### Day 1: Initial Contact

**Channel**: LinkedIn InMail (for cold) or Email (for warm)
**Template**: Use Template 1 or 2 from `02-outreach-templates.md`

**Goal**: Initial outreach, spark interest

**What to track**:
- ✓ Message sent (timestamp)
- ✓ Message type (warm/cold/referral/event)
- ✓ First-touch indicator
- ✓ Subject line used

**What to do after**:
- If no response in 24 hours → Continue to Day 2
- If interested/discovery scheduled → Move to Discovery questions script

---

### Day 2: Value-Add Follow-Up

**Channel**: Same as Day 1 (don't switch unless Day 1 was phone call)

**Template**: New angle or resource

**Body Example**:
```
Hi [Name],

Quick follow-up on my message from [Day 1]. Wanted to share a resource that's been helpful for orgs in [prospect's industry]:

[Specific resource: whitepaper link, case study, tool guide]

The pattern I'm seeing: Companies that succeed at AI transformation do readiness assessments first, then build. The ones that skip this step are 4x more likely to fail within 6 months (MIT research).

If this is relevant to your current initiatives, thought it might save you some trial-and-error.

No pressure—just found your earlier message relevant and wanted to share this.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Goal**: Add value without pressure

**What to track**:
- ✓ Message sent
- ✓ Resource shared (link, name)
- ✓ New angle introduced

**What to do after**:
- If no response in 24-48 hours → Continue to Day 3
- If engagement → Schedule discovery call
- If not interested → Mark as "Not a fit" in CRM, stop cadence

---

### Day 5: Channel Switch + Social Proof

**Channel**: Switch to opposite channel from Day 1 & 2
- If Day 1 & 2 were email → Send LinkedIn connection request
- If Day 1 & 2 were LinkedIn → Send phone call + voicemail

**Template**: Use connection request or phone script

**Body Example** (for LinkedIn connection after email):
```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my messages from earlier this week—wanted to send a connection request here on LinkedIn.

Context: We help companies move from AI curiosity to deployed systems in 4-8 weeks. The orgs that succeed assess readiness first, then ship production code.

[Mutual connection or reference: Name] mentioned I should connect—thought it would be valuable.

If you're open to connecting, great. If not, no worries at all.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Body Example** (for phone after LinkedIn/LinkedIn):
```
Hi [Name],

This is [Your Name] from John Ellison—following up on my earlier messages about AI transformation.

Quick value-add: I wanted to share a case study that's relevant to [prospect's industry]. We worked with [similar company] and helped them move from AI experimentation to deployed systems in 4 weeks, achieving 47% productivity gains.

The key was they did a readiness assessment first, then built. Saved them 14 months of trial-and-error.

Would 15 minutes be worth discussing how this approach could apply to [prospect's company]?

If I miss you, I'll send a brief message with the case study link—happy to share either way.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Goal**: Re-engage through different channel

**What to track**:
- ✓ Channel switched (email → LinkedIn OR LinkedIn → phone)
- ✓ Message sent
- ✓ New value point (case study, testimonial, tool guide)

**What to do after**:
- If no response in 24-48 hours → Continue to Day 7
- If engagement → Schedule discovery call
- If not interested → Move to Day 10

---

### Day 7: Objection Addressing + Direct Question

**Channel**: Return to original channel (usually email at this point)

**Template**: Address common objection with new angle

**Body Example**:
```
Hi [Name],

Following up again on [Day 1 message about AI transformation].

I wanted to address a concern that comes up a lot when I have these conversations: "We don't have budget right now" or "We're exploring internally."

Here's what I'm seeing in the market:

Organizations that try to build AI without assessing readiness first are 4x more likely to fail within 6 months (MIT data).

Phase 1 of our engagement is actually about de-risking the investment. It's a 1-2 week readiness assessment ($10k-$20k) that gives you:
- Clear picture of where you stand across 6 dimensions
- Prioritized roadmap of which AI products to build first
- Governance framework so you don't hit compliance blocks later

The companies that succeed don't skip this step—they do the assessment first, then build. It's the fastest path.

If budget is the blocker, we can structure Phase 1 as a diagnostic that pays for itself through the savings it identifies.

Simple question: Would 15 minutes next week be worth discussing whether Phase 1 makes sense for [prospect's company]?

If not now, no worries—I'll hold here and check back in a month.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Alternative Body** (if no budget objection):
```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my earlier messages about AI transformation at [Company].

Quick context: I'm finding most companies I speak with fall into one of two patterns:

1. They assess readiness first, identify clear blockers, then build with confidence
2. They skip assessment, jump into building, and discover blockers 6 months in (wasting $50k-$200k)

The second approach is 4x less likely to succeed. The assessment is actually a shortcut—it compresses 6 months of trial-and-error into 2 weeks of clarity.

If you're open to it, I'd love to schedule 15 minutes next week to discuss how we can help you avoid the pilot trap and move straight to building what matters.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Goal**: Remove objections with data-backed response

**What to track**:
- ✓ Objection addressed (budget, timing, internal team)
- ✓ Data point shared (research, case study)
- ✓ Direct question asked

**What to do after**:
- If no response in 48-72 hours → Continue to Day 10
- If engagement → Schedule discovery call
- If soft "not now" → Add to nurture list, check back in 30 days

---

### Day 10: Final Value-Add + Soft Breakup

**Channel**: Email (best channel for final attempt)

**Template**: Last value-add with clear close

**Body Example**:
```
Hi [Name],

I've been following up on AI transformation for [Company Name] over the past few weeks—shared some resources, answered questions about blockers.

Haven't heard back, so I wanted to reach out one final time with something concrete:

A case study from [similar company or industry] that might be relevant. We helped them move from AI pilots to deployed systems, and they're now seeing [specific outcome—e.g., 47% productivity gain, $72k/year savings].

Here's the link if you'd like to review: [case study link]

If AI transformation isn't a priority right now, totally understand. These things move in cycles, and I'd be happy to reconnect when timing is better.

If you ever want to explore this in the future, you know where to find me.

All the best,
[Your Name]
```

**Goal**: Provide final value + graceful exit

**What to track**:
- ✓ Final resource shared
- ✓ Breakup message sent
- ✓ Prospect status: "Not Interested" or "Nurture"

**What to do after**:
- **If no response**: Mark as "Nurture" in CRM, add to monthly check-in list (30-90 days)
- **If "not now"**: Add to "Timing" list (check back in 60-90 days)
- **If interested**: If they engaged but didn't schedule, add to "Follow-up" list (reach out in 14-21 days)

---

### Day 14+: Long-Term Nurture

**When to use**: Only for prospects marked as "Nurture" or "Timing"

**Frequency**: Monthly or quarterly (don't spam them)

**Template**: Low-pressure check-ins

**Body Example**:
```
Hi [Name],

Quick check-in—wanted to see how things are going with AI at [Company Name].

Saw [specific update or news about their company—congratulations on the milestone / thought this might be relevant].

No pressure at all—just keeping the door open if timing improves on your end.

If AI transformation becomes a priority, I'd love to reconnect. Until then, wishing you all the best.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**What to track**:
- ✓ Nurse message sent
- ✓ Date sent
- ✓ Any engagement (likes, comments, replies)

**Nurse cadence**:
- Monthly for first 3 months
- Quarterly for months 4-12
- Stop after 12 months if no engagement

---

## CRM Status Tracking

After each touch, update prospect with one of these statuses:

### Active Outreach
- **New**: First touch, no history
- **Contacted**: Day 1-7, in cadence
- **Engaged**: Responded, in conversation
- **Discovery Scheduled**: Call booked
- **Qualified**: Passed BANT/MEDDIC, moving to proposal

### Disposition Codes
- **Not Interested**: Replied "not interested" or "not now"
- **Bad Fit**: Wrong company size, role, or industry
- **Timing**: "Not right time" or "Check back in Q2"
- **Budget**: "No budget" or "Allocated elsewhere"
- **Competitor**: "Working with [competitor]"
- **Ghosted**: No response after Day 10

### Nurture
- **Monthly Nurture**: Check in every 30-90 days
- **Quarterly Nurture**: Check in every 90-180 days

---

## Automation Rules

### What to Automate
- **Day 2**: Schedule 48 hours after Day 1 if no response (Boomerang, Mixmax)
- **Day 5**: Schedule LinkedIn connection request if email sequence
- **Day 7**: Schedule follow-up if prior email went unanswered
- **Day 10**: Schedule final email with resource attachment

### What Never to Automate
- **Initial Day 1 message**: Always manual, requires personalization
- **Phone calls**: Always manual (use notes, not scripts)
- **Breakup messages**: Always manual (review context first)

---

## Key Metrics to Track

### Weekly
- Messages sent
- Response rate (responses / messages sent)
- Discovery calls booked
- Proposals sent

### Monthly
- Deals closed
- Revenue generated
- Average deal size
- Lead-to-close time

---

## Quick Reference

### Message Angles by Day
| Day | Channel | Angle | Goal |
|------|----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | InMail/Email | Initial outreach + value prop | Spark interest |
| 2 | Same as Day 1 | Resource add (whitepaper, case study) | Add value |
| 3 | Switch (LinkedIn/Phone) | Social proof + new channel | Re-engage |
| 4 | Same as Day 1 | Objection handling | Remove barrier |
| 5 | Switch (Phone/LinkedIn) | Direct question | Create urgency |
| 7 | Same as Day 1 | Objection + value | Last push |
| 10 | Email | Final resource + breakup | Graceful exit |

---

## Handling Common Responses

### "We've been really busy"
**Response:**
"Totally understand—timing matters. I'll check back in [timeframe: 30-60 days] when things slow down a bit."

**Action**: Add to "Timing" nurture list

---

### "Send me more information"
**Response:**
"Happy to! Here's the [whitepaper / case study / guide] I mentioned earlier:

[Link or brief summary]

If anything else comes up, just let me know. Happy to be a resource."

**Action**: Update CRM, send resource, continue to next step in cadence

---

### "We're going in a different direction"
**Response:**
"Thanks for the update. Totally understand—these things move in cycles.

If AI transformation comes back on the radar, I'd love to reconnect. I'll add you to my nurture list and check in quarterly to see if timing has improved.

Wishing you all the best in the meantime,

[Your Name]"

**Action**: Mark as "Timing" disposition, add to quarterly nurture

---

### "We're working with [Competitor]"
**Response:**
"Good to know—always helpful to understand the landscape.

Without getting into specifics, here's what we focus on that differentiates us:

1. **We assess readiness first**: Most firms jump straight to building. We identify blockers so you don't waste months on broken foundations
2. **We ship production code**: Not decks or strategy documents. You get working software in 4-8 weeks
3. **Knowledge transfer**: Your team builds with us, learns methodology, can keep iterating after we leave
4. **Vendor-neutral**: We're not tied to OpenAI, Anthropic, or any specific stack. You build on your infrastructure

If priorities shift, would love to reconnect. No pressure at all."

**Action**: Mark as "Competitor" disposition, add to 6-month nurture list

---

## Best Practices

### Do's
✓ **Track everything**: Every message, response, objection, resource share goes in CRM
✓ **Time-box your outreach**: 30 min morning, 30 min afternoon = 60 min/day focused
✓ **Vary your angles**: Don't send same message twice
✓ **Add value every time**: Never "just checking in" without new content
✓ **Use data points**: Reference research, case studies, whitepapers
✓ **Clear CTA**: One specific ask (15-min call, see resource, connect on LinkedIn)
✓ **Follow up systematically**: 5-7 touches over 14 days, then nurture
✓ **Switch channels**: Mix email, LinkedIn, phone to break through
✓ **Respect "no"**: Accept it gracefully, don't argue
✓ **Follow up to 14 days**: If no engagement, Day 14 is final for this cadence

### Don'ts
✗ **Don't stop after 1-2 touches**: 80% of sales require 5+ follow-ups
✗ **Don't send generic "following up" messages**: Always add new angle or value
✗ **Don't chase indefinitely**: Day 14 is final for this cadence
✗ **Don't send Monday morning cold emails**: Lowest response day
✗ **Don't use aggressive language**: "Limited time," "Final offer," "Close now"
✗ **Don't automate personal touch**: Initial outreach must be personalized
✗ **Don't ignore clear "not interested"**: Mark disposition, move on

## Psychology Hacks

### For Your Specific Challenge (Scrolling/Distraction)

You mentioned finding it hard to sit and scroll through socials. Here's how this cadence system is designed to help:

### 1. No Scrolling Required
- Pre-build hit lists (20-40 contacts/day ready to go)
- Open → Execute → Close loop
- Never browse LinkedIn looking for prospects

### 2. Time-Boxed (Not Open-Ended)
- Set calendar: 9:00-9:30 AM block, 1:00-1:30 PM block
- Commit to X messages per block (e.g., 5 messages in morning block)
- When block ends, take a break. Don't drag it out.

### 3. Tiny First Step (Overcome Inertia)
- Start your day by sending 1 message (not opening email inbox)
- Momentum trick: Do 1 thing, it's easier to do 2
- By 9:30 AM, you'll have 5-10 messages sent. Much harder to skip.

### 4. End-of-Day Accountability
- Text a friend at 6 PM: "How many outreach messages did you send today?"
- Public commitment keeps you honest
- If you missed target, send a catch-up message before bed

**See `09-psychological-hacks.md` for complete playbook.**

- **Tier 1 leads (hot/warm)**: 30-40% response rate
- **Tier 2 leads (warm)**: 15-25% response rate
- **Tier 3 leads (cold)**: 3-10% response rate

### Conversion Targets
- **Response to discovery call**: 40-50%
- **Discovery to proposal**: 50-70%
- **Proposal to close**: 30-50%

### ROI Targets
- **Monthly revenue goal**: 1-2 deals
- **Average deal size**: $35k-$70k
- **Lead-to-close time**: 14-30 days

---

## Daily Workflow Integration

This cadence integrates with your daily 90-minute outreach workflow defined in `07-daily-execution.md`.

**Morning Block (30-45 min)**:
- Send Day 2 follow-ups (scheduled + manual)
- Review yesterday's responses and update CRM
- Prepare today's afternoon hit list

**Afternoon Block (30-45 min)**:
- Send Day 5 outreach (scheduled + manual)
- Handle responses to morning messages
- Build tomorrow's hit lists

**Evening (15-30 min)**:
- Final CRM updates for the day
- Prepare tomorrow's templates based on learnings
- Weekly metrics review (Monday: plan for Tuesday-Friday)

---

**Remember**: Consistency beats perfection. 10 messages/day for 5 days = 50 touches = 20+ responses = 10 calls = 2-3 proposals/month = 1-2 deals/month.

That's how you get from zero to booked.
