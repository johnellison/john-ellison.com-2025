## Outreach Templates Quick Reference

### Warm Outreach (LinkedIn DM)
```
Hey [First Name],

Hope you're doing well. I've been thinking about our conversation on [specific topic] and wanted to reach out.

I'm working on something I think could be relevant to [Company Name]. We're helping Series A-C companies move from AI experimentation to deployed systems in 4-8 weeks—not pilots, actual production code.

Does any of that resonate?

If so, I'd love to send over our free 8-minute readiness assessment.

Let me know if you're curious.

Best,  
John
```

### Cold Outreach (Email)
```
Subject: Stop treating AI like a tool. Start shipping it.

Hi [First Name],

I help companies like [Company Name] move from AI experimentation to deployed systems in 4-8 weeks—not decks, not pilots, actual production code.

The companies we work with tend to be stuck in one of three places:
1. Board pressure to "do something with AI" but no clear strategy
2. Pilot projects that never make it to production
3. Internal resistance from teams who don't see the ROI

If any of that resonates, I'd love to send you our 8-minute readiness assessment. It scores you across 6 dimensions and flags your blockers.

Worth 8 minutes of your time?

Best,  
John Ellison

### Day 2 Follow-Up (Email)
```
Subject: Resource: AI readiness for [Company Name]

Hi [First Name],

I know inboxes are chaos, so I'll keep this short.

I reached out earlier this week about our AI transformation work, but whether or not we work together, I wanted to send over something useful:

→ Free 8-minute AI Readiness Assessment: [link]

It scores your organization across 6 dimensions (leadership, data, tech, talent, governance, culture) and shows you where the gaps are.

Worth 8 minutes if you're exploring AI strategy this quarter.

Let me know if you have questions.

Best,  
John
```

## Sales Call Structure (60 minutes)

### Discovery Questions (20 min)
1. "What's your current relationship with AI in the organization?"
2. "Are you running any pilots or have you shipped anything to production?"
3. "What triggered this conversation?"
4. "What's preventing you from moving faster right now?"
5. "If you could wave a wand and have one AI-powered internal product working 6 months from now, what would it be?"

### Positioning & Education (15 min)
- Share insight: "94% of AI implementations fail because they bolt AI onto broken processes."
- Explain readiness framework: "The 6% that succeed assess readiness first."

### Qualification (10 min)
- "Who else needs to be part of this decision?"
- "Have you allocated budget for AI transformation this year?"
- "What's your timeline?"

### Close (10 min)
- **If High Readiness:** "Let's schedule the Phase 1 diagnostic workshop."

## Objection Handling Quick Reference

**"That's expensive"**  
→ "Let's talk ROI. What does it cost you right now to *not* have this problem solved? If your ops team spends 15 hours/week on manual work, that's $72k/year wasted."

**"Can we skip the assessment?"**  
→ "Skipping the diagnostic is like starting surgery without an MRI. You'll miss critical blockers and waste months. The assessment *is* the shortcut."

**"Our tech team can handle this"**  
→ "Your tech team is critical. But tech is 15% of the equation. Data, governance, and culture are the other 85% that determine adoption."

**"We need to think about it"**  
→ "Totally fair. What specific part do you need to think through? Budget, timing, or scope?"

2. **Tomorrow:** Build Tier 1 list (50 hot leads)
3. **Day 3:** Send first 10 messages (Tier 1 only)
4. **Week 1:** Send 100 messages, book 5-10 calls
5. **Week 2:** Scale to 20 messages/day, send first proposal
6. **Month 1:** Close first deal

---

## Questions or Sticking Points?

If you get stuck on any part of this system:
1. Review the relevant document (01-07)
2. Simplify: Cut daily target to 10 messages instead of 20
3. Ask for help: Reach out to accountability partner or coach

**Remember:** Consistency beats perfection. 10 messages/day for 5 days = 50 messages = 10 responses = 5 calls. That's enough to close 1 deal/month.
