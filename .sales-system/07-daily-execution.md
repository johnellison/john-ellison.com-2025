  - Status: `Cold - No Response`

**Afternoon (After Block 2):**
- [ ] Log 10 outreach messages
- [ ] Same fields as above

**Evening (After Block 3):**
- [ ] Update statuses based on responses:
  - `Cold - No Response` → No change
  - `Active - Sent Assessment` → If they requested assessment
  - `Active - Call Scheduled` → If call booked

  - `Nurture - Follow Up [Date]` → If bad timing

---

### Follow-Up Reminder System

- Set task for "Day 10 Follow-Up" (10 days from outreach)

**Alternative (Spreadsheet):**
- Add column: "Next Follow-Up Date"
- Filter by today's date each day

---

## Sales Call Workflow

### Goal: Book 5-10 Sales Calls Per Week

**Average Conversion Funnel:**
- 100 outreach messages → 20 responses (20% response rate)
- 20 responses → 10 calls booked (50% booking rate)
- 10 calls → 2-3 proposals (20-30% close-to-proposal)
- 2-3 proposals → 1 deal (30-50% proposal-to-close)

**Math:**
- To close 1 deal/month: Need 10-15 sales calls/month
- To book 10-15 calls/month: Need 20-30 responses/month
- To get 20-30 responses: Need 100-150 outreach messages/month
- **Daily Target:** 20 messages/day × 5 days/week = 100/week = 400/month

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: "I don't know who to message"
**Solution:** Use Tier 1 list. You have 50-100 hot leads already (Optimize Media, Tom Wood, Pikl, Regenera). Start there.

### Pitfall 2: "I'm spending too much time on research"
**Solution:** Time-box to 5 min for Tier 1, 2 min for Tier 2, no research for Tier 3. Use templates.

### Pitfall 3: "I'm not getting responses"
**Solution:** Review response rates. If <10%, your messaging is off. Test new subject lines, hooks, or templates.

### Pitfall 4: "I'm getting overwhelmed"
**Solution:** Cut daily target to 10 messages/day instead of 20. Better to be consistent than burn out.

### Pitfall 5: "I keep procrastinating"
**Solution:** Set a timer for 30 minutes. Tell yourself: "I only have to do this for 30 minutes." Once you start, momentum builds.
