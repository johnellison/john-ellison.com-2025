Please see transcript from my chat with Fatma below for helping us create an online event (Fishbowl) around AI-Human Leadership or "Working with Superintelligence", something like that.

I'd like you to go ahead and synthesize the conversation that we had along with the research from Perplexity to help us generate a title, description, and summary for an online event that will be 60-90 minutes on February 13th, Thursday at 5pm Central European. It will be myself, John Ellison, and Fatma Ghadira as well as likely an amazing Behavioral Scientist named Stephan Ledain (https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanledain/) from (https://youhavetoadapt.com/) and AI Implementation Strategist and one other person who does Human-AI Leadership work.


-- MEETING TRANSCRIPT (PARTIAL --

impact we want to have because this happened. Like, what would this potentially create in the world culture, in the world, like, what do you feel? From a non-monetary standpoint? Yeah, first. What would you love it to create? I mean, for me, I want people to get excited about building meaningful products and having agency to solve the problems that are addressing them and their organizations. And that there are now new tools available and new possibilities that have never been available before, and we should use it for purpose, you know, to get people oriented around the combination of the power and the responsibility to good work with it. What about you? Yeah. So similar to you, I want people to get some literacy about these tools and how they can be using them for good. But also, what is very important for me is to develop language and awareness around what these tools are actually going to do to our lives. Yeah, and our brains. And our brains and our relational dynamics. Nice, I like that. And to make sure that we build the right relationship with the tool. Like that is the ultimate intention for me, because it's not helpful if we just be like, no, we're not using this at all. And it's not helpful if we are using it and becoming dependent on it. Yeah, and blind to its externalities. Exactly. So similar to any relationship, if there is dependency, then it becomes like a clutch versus how can I use this as a superpower and relate to it in a healthy way. For me, it's super important because that could actually be the demise of humanity if we become solely dependent on it emotionally and... Yeah. And practically, you know, and we stop thinking, we stop relating to others. We lose our, lose what makes us human. Exactly, like, I imagine people just starting to work in silo and not wanting to relate to any members of the team or to their families because they have this. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. That's what I'm really concerned about. And us socially getting even more atrophied than the social skills. Yeah, it's an interesting framing. It's at a big picture, evolutionarily working together around shared goals is what allowed us to survive and overcome environmental obstacles and, you know, last beyond other homo species, beyond the sapien. And now that very skill has developed a technology that is eroding our fundamental human qualities while also giving us the appearance of having these superpowers, but only if we depend upon this machine. There's some interesting. Which keeps asking of our attention. So you could spend a whole day giving it your attention and let go of like meeting with stakeholders in the company with whom you need to be meeting to make like an initiative that you've been working on ChatGPT for months on to be able to, but then if you lack the skills to be able to go and rally for your ideas or get the right stakeholders to support you working on it, then what is the purpose of that idea and that project that you've been working on with ChatGPT in an isolated little screen and becomes like the black box. Yeah. Yeah, interesting. Very interesting. Okay, so I think it'd be interesting also to synthesize the research you did around the human AI. leadership stuff that you had in perplexity, right? Or in notebook? Yeah. And perplexity, I think. And perplexity. Okay. It would be nice if you can send me that. I mean, it's already in my perplexity. It's my account. You just tell me what we just search for it together. But I think, yeah, it would be nice to look at that so we can ground it in whatever research is done around workplace dynamics, AI implementation. Yes. And basically, we want to target, in my mind, the same companies that I want for my product sprint work, which is series A to series C mid-sized companies who are working with AI at some level and looking to do more robust rollout. They want AI transformation. They want AI strategy. They want to bring it deeper into their organization and get, you know, more ROI from it. And they, that's one category, I guess. The others, those who are having struggles with, you know, implementing AI in their teams, either because people are resisting it or they spend a bunch of money and it's not having any outcomes they'd have hoped. I mean, I think there's a few different audiences, but, you know, selfishly speaking, my kind of focus brain is on companies that will eventually want to. Have implementation work done and transformation work done off the back of it. Or maybe they bought some stuff and they don't want to implement them because it's not working on the team level for them to implement anything. I do see you doing implementation work, not even from like a building technology baby. I feel like you're going to fall in love with group work. This is my feeling. You're going to be like, shit, this is so cool. I get to use my emotions and be with people and not have, but also it's all around technology without having it have to be you sitting and building products, you know? Yeah, sure, sure. He says that what I talked about with Stefani today, he's like, building products is like 20 to 30% of the real work of implementation. I feel that. And I want you to like, just stay open, baby, as I know this is what you're enjoying right now. You need to understand it well. I don't feel that would be the ultimate purpose. So that's why, open it and see what the universe is giving, is replying back to us. Yeah, no, no, of course, it's just, I also need to be commercially focused around what I know I can deliver and get revenue for. So that's all I'm saying for me. But maybe if you have people, if you have an organization who bought tools, but they cannot use it, imagine they spend thousands. Yeah, this is more your bread and butter, I would say. No. No, because I do feel like you are also well established considering that you understand the technology well and you understand humans more than any technology person I know. Yeah, I mean, I might, but I think, I agree that's a great opportunity for us to do together, which I think is great. We want to be able to generate leads for us to do together. But just in terms of my approach of like, I want more pickle clients for right now of people who want me to come in and implement so I can refine this skill and get a really solid package. And my hypothesis is then be off the back of that, we can upskill the transformation, the implementation, the rollout, but that I want to, like, I need revenue in the next six weeks, you know? I know. I think the assumption you're making here is that that will not make revenue even though from what I've been reading, the huge struggle is not people building technology. Of course, of course. I'm open to it. And I do feel like because of your gravitas and who you are as a technologist, they will listen to you. They will never listen to me. Do you get what I mean? Yeah, totally. I'm open to it. But I didn't, you know, at no point in this journey so far have I thought, I want to reposition what I'm doing towards, you know, supporting people. Yeah, I'm open to it, to whatever comes through. Even at exactly what you're saying, but there is a difference between the primary task, what is like what we want to be doing, versus the espoused task that people think we need to be doing. Do you get what I mean? Like, you might want to say, this is what I want to do. I want to come and implement technology and build technology, not just implement it. But do you remember in the last client with, what's her name, Pickle, the hurdles you got with the fact that people... that stakeholders were not as involved and we don't know what's going to happen with the rollout. There are some people that were influenced and very moved and wanted to like learn more from this, but they were like left behind. Like it's what you did was awesome from a technology perspective, but then maybe if there is not the right network set up for people to receive the technology and use it, then it might be just another checkbox of, oh, now we have the AI tools. But then 90% of the integration is failing. And imagine six months from now, these people will not be using any of the tools that you tried to implement there. Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's a possibility, but what are you suggesting? That we, are you talking about the topic of the webinar? Are you talking about the like? I'm talking even about the philosophy of this work as I want after I listened to Stefan yesterday. I think it's very primed by your recent conversation with him, what you're saying now. And the research I've been doing, baby. I understand that. I understand that. But, so you're just saying to just open the framing, basically. Open the framing for the pain points to serve the pain points, even though as you're coming in, you're serving implementation, for example. But at the end of the day, you're going to be building tools. Do you get what I mean? For the tools that they bought.

We are looking at trying to get leads for more clients from companies like Pikl who are Series A and beyond, scaling and needing to get to grips with their AI strategy. They're using ChatGPT and other tools but haven't done a deep dive into the organization as a whole

This is research from Perplexity on this issue:

AI implementation often fails due to strategic oversights, with failure rates reaching 70-95% primarily from human factors rather than technology. Research highlights pitfalls in planning, data, and skills, alongside deep human dynamics like resistance and role confusion. Leadership plays a pivotal role in navigating these for events like your Human-AI Leadership fishbowl discussion.
​

Strategy Pitfalls
Organizations underestimate AI complexity, leading to stalled pilots—McKinsey notes only 20% track KPIs effectively. Common issues include misaligned objectives, data silos, scalability gaps, and absent roadmaps, causing resource waste. Poor data quality and infrastructure exacerbate failures, with 68% of IT leaders citing skill shortages.
​

Human Dynamics Issues
Unclear roles in human-AI teams cause delays and frustration, while data fragmentation and ethical biases amplify problems. Employee resistance stems from job fears, exclusion from decisions, and trust gaps—up to 70% of changes fail due to these. Social dynamics like change fatigue and weak peer networks trap projects in "pilot hell".
​

Leadership Challenges
Leaders face resistance, skill gaps, and adaptability demands, with 70% of issues people-related. They must foster AI-augmenting cultures, transparent communication, and governance to counter bias and turnover risks. Without strong buy-in, ethical concerns and reputation risks hinder adoption.
​

Key Discussion Points
Role clarity: Define human-AI boundaries to boost performance.
​

Change management: Address fears via awareness and involvement.
​

Cultural shift: Prioritize augmentation over replacement.
​

Governance: Build policies for ethics and data sharing.
​

This synthesis draws from recent studies, ideal for feeding your fishbowl on AI's human future—aligning with your Human-AI Leadership incubator.

Common human and group dynamics that derail AI projects
Common human and group dynamics frequently derail AI projects, contributing to 70-95% failure rates through resistance, trust gaps, and misalignments. These issues manifest in emotional fears, workflow disruptions, and organizational silos, stalling adoption despite technical readiness. Addressing them requires targeted change management for your fishbowl discussions on human-AI leadership.
​

Employee Resistance
Workers resist due to job loss fears, anxiety, and lack of AI literacy—72% distrust unfamiliar tools. This creates low adoption, with frontline staff feeling excluded from decisions. Cultural inertia in hierarchical groups amplifies reluctance to new workflows.
​

Trust and Experience Gaps
A stark divide exists: executives trust AI highly, while frontline workers remain skeptical, leading to feedback loops that kill momentum. Overtrust or undertrust in humanlike AI causes maladaptive interactions and deskilling. Missing guidance increases labor burdens like evaluating AI outputs.
​

Group Misalignments
Stakeholder silos cause conflicts—business leaders push strategic goals, but IT faces data realities, derailing execution. Frontline seeks practical fixes; leaders focus strategically, trapping projects in pilots. Poor peer dynamics and adaptability hinder experimentation.
​

Common Derailers Table
Dynamic	Impact	Example [web:id]
Anxiety & Fear	25% rise in depression/anxiety blocks uptake	Mass reluctance despite benefits 
​
Role Confusion	Workflow disruptions, extra labor	No frameworks for human-AI decisions 
​
Silo Conflicts	Resource fights, stalled pilots	Dept misalignments on objectives 
​
Low Adaptability	Failure to iterate	Hierarchical resistance to change 
​
Common human and group dynamics that derail AI projects
Common human and group dynamics derail most AI projects through trust gaps, role confusion, and resistance, with 63% of failures tied to people issues per research on 1,100+ professionals . Frontline skepticism clashes with executive optimism, creating feedback loops that stall adoption . These patterns align with your fishbowl focus on conscious human-AI leadership.

Trust and Proficiency Gaps
Frontline workers face steep learning curves (22%), poor prompt skills (11%), and inadequate training (6%), dwarfing technical issues . Executives trust AI highly while workers remain skeptical, limiting input on tools . 71% of organizations distrust autonomous AI, causing <30% adoption rates.

Role Ambiguity and Conflicts
Unclear human-AI roles lead to duplicated tasks, delays, and frustration, hurting low/medium-skill teams most. Silos fragment data and decisions, with business-IT misalignments trapping projects in pilots. Change fatigue spikes turnover 34% when AI handles >50% tasks without governance.

Resistance and Cultural Barriers
Fear of job loss, bias persistence, and exclusion fuel reluctance—36% lack training. Hierarchical structures discourage experimentation, contrasting successful firms that empower choice . Ethical concerns like biased advice perpetuate discrimination without human oversight.

Mitigation Strategies
Democratize skills via mentorship and role-specific training .

Enable individual tool choice with governance .

Foster experimentation and internal expertise over consultants .

Use human-in-the-loop for accountability.
