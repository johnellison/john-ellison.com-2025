## 🎯 YOUR GO-TO-MARKET POSITIONING

### **Against Big Consultants:**
*"You need strategic readiness guidance in 2 weeks, not a 3-month engagement. We assess faster, cheaper, and give you a clear roadmap. For transformation, you can choose your partner."*

### **Against Cloud Vendors:**
*"We don't sell cloud platforms. We're independent. We tell you if AWS, Azure, or GCP is right—or if you need neither. No bias."*

### **Against Academic Frameworks:**
*"We translate academic rigor into business language. You get a score + 3 specific blockers with costs and timelines, not 20 dimensions of complexity."*

### **Against Existing SaaS Players:**
*"They give you a generic score. We give you a prioritized action plan. They assess once. We measure your progress every 90 days."*
