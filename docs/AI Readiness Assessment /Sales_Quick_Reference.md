# Sales Quick Reference: AI Readiness Assessment
**One-page cheat sheet for discovery, positioning, and closing**

---

## ⚡ OPENING: THE PROBLEM (30 seconds)

*"We've analyzed 200+ AI implementations. Here's what we found: 60% fail, but it's almost never because the technology wasn't good enough. It's because the organization wasn't ready. We help organizations assess their readiness in 2 weeks, then close the specific gaps that are holding them back."*

**Key message:** Readiness, not technology, is the issue.

## 📊 MOST POWERFUL DATA POINTS (Copy-Paste Ready!)

**General/Opener:**
- "60% of AI projects fail due to organizational readiness gaps, not technology."
- "Organizations scoring 60+ on readiness achieve 75% implementation success vs. 25% for those under 40."

**Data (Blocker #1):**
- "98% of organizations cite data quality as a blocker. On average, it costs $12.9M annually in poor decisions."
- "Most organizations spend 40-60% of analyst time on data cleaning instead of insight generation."

**Talent (Blocker #2):**
- "52% of organizations lack internal AI/ML expertise. Salary premiums are 30-50% above market, and hiring takes 2-4 months."

**Legacy Systems (Blocker #3):**
- "93% cite legacy system integration as a blocker. Fragmented data sources prevent AI from working effectively."

**Change Management (Blocker #4):**
- "46% of employees initially fear AI will replace their jobs. Without addressing this, adoption rates drop to 20-30%. With psychological safety, they jump to 75%+."
- "Executives using AI visibly in their own work increases team adoption from 30% to 75%."

**Timeline (Why 12-18 months?):**
- "Organizations attempting 6-month transformation consistently overshoot timeline by 2-3x. Those planning 12-18 months hit them on time."

**ROI (The payoff):**
- "Organizations investing 6-12 months in readiness work achieve 2-3x better ROI and 70% faster time-to-value."
- "Finance automation delivers 40% reduction in close time and 35% cost reduction."

## 🛑 COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### **Objection 1: "We're already working with [Big Consulting Firm]."**
**Response:** "They take 2-3 months and give you a generic maturity framework. We take 2 weeks, give you exact blockers + costs to fix + 12-month plan. Plus, we're focused on readiness transformation, not 50 other services."

### **Objection 2: "This sounds expensive. What's the ROI?"**
**Response:** "Good question. If data quality issues are costing you $5-10M annually—and 98% of organizations have them—the ROI on fixing that blocker is 5-10x. A $300K acceleration program pays for itself in 2-4 months of recovered value."

### **Objection 3: "We need AI deployed fast. Can you do this in 6 months?"**
**Response:** "I understand the urgency. Here's what we've learned: organizations attempting 6-month transformations typically miss timelines by 2-3x and have 60%+ failure rates. Those planning 12-18 months hit their targets and succeed 75% of the time. The fastest path is the thoughtful one."

### **Objection 4: "We have good technical teams. That should be enough."**
**Response:** "Technical skill is about 30% of the equation. The other 70% is data governance, organizational alignment, change management, and cultural readiness. We've seen brilliant teams fail because the organization wasn't ready."

### **Objection 5: "We don't want to get locked into a long engagement."**
**Response:** "We structure it as a 12-month program with clear milestones at months 3, 6, and 9. You evaluate progress and can adjust. Most clients expand because they've seen the value."

### **Objection 6: "Can we just buy your assessment tool and do this ourselves?"**
**Response:** "You could, but most organizations get stuck. The assessment is valuable, but the interpretation + roadmap + execution support is where the magic happens. It's like taking an X-ray—useful, but you need a doctor to read it and prescribe treatment."

**"I need to think about it / Get back to you / Talk to my team"**

**Response:** "Of course! Quick question—what's the one thing that would make you want to move forward quickly? Is it [timeline? cost? confidence?]. That way when you talk to your team, I know what to address."

## ✋ WHEN TO WALK AWAY

**Not a good fit if:**
- Score is 0-20 AND no budget for 18-month transformation
- They want deployment in <6 months without acknowledging readiness gaps
- Leadership not aligned
- They've had 3+ failed initiatives and learned nothing
- They're looking for a tool, not a partner

**What to say:** "I don't think we're the right fit right now. You might benefit more from [alternative]. But let's stay in touch—when you're ready to tackle this systematically, we can talk."

## 🚀 REMEMBER

- **You're not selling a tool.** You're selling clarity + a pathway to success.
- **Readiness is the blocker, not technology.**
- **40-60 segment is your sweet spot.** Focus there first.
- **Data points win conversations.** Use them liberally.
- **Every objection points to a real blocker.** Address it.
- **The assessment is diagnostic.** The roadmap is the product.

*Now go sell. 60% fail. You help them succeed.*
