# AI Readiness Assessment Tool: Executive Summary
**Strategic Research & Launch Framework**

---

## THE OPPORTUNITY

**Market Context:**
- **60% of AI projects fail** due to organizational readiness gaps, not technology
- **$1+ trillion** spent globally on AI by 2025; most ROI unrealized
- **Gap:** No standard framework for assessing readiness before transformation
- **Your positioning:** "Assessment → Readiness Transformation → AI Product Sprints"

**Why Now:**
- Enterprises recognize readiness matters (post-2024 pilot disappointment)
- Shift from "How do we adopt AI?" to "Are we ready for AI?"
- Regulatory pressure (GDPR, CCPA, EU AI Act) makes governance urgent
- Talent shortages make readiness + retention strategy interdependent

## THE FRAMEWORK: 6 CORE READINESS DIMENSIONS

| Dimension | Weight | Why Critical | #1 Blocker | Timeline to Fix | Cost to Fix |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Leadership & Strategy** | 20% | Sets direction; predicts success | No executive sponsor | 3-6 mo | $50-200K |
| **Data Readiness** ⭐ | 25% | HIGHEST IMPACT blocker | Data quality (98% cite) | 12-24 mo | $300K-2M |
| **Tech Infrastructure** | 15% | Prerequisite for scale | Legacy system integration (93%) | 6-12 mo | $150-500K |
| **Talent & Capability** | 15% | Creates velocity | Lack of expertise (52%) | 6-12 mo | $150-500K |
| **Governance** | 10% | Compliance + speed | No governance (57% lack it) | 3-6 mo | $50-200K |
| **Culture & Change** | 15% | Predicts adoption | Fear of displacement (46%) | 6-12 mo | $50-200K |

**Key Insight:** No single dimension matters more than the others. All six predict success. Organizations strong in 4/6 achieve 75%+ implementation success; <3/6 fail 65% of the time.
