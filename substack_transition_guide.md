**I’m expanding the ecosystem**

I’m continuing to publish here on Regenera just as before. However, some stories demand more than static text.

I’ve begun creating interactive "micro-sites" on my personal website, [john-ellison.com](https://john-ellison.com), to visualize data in dynamic ways that standard newsletters simply can’t support (like my recent technical deep dives into AI Mineral Exploration).

My new site is now the central hub for my podcasts, essays, and the new **Executive AI Assessment**, designed for leaders who need to measure their organizational readiness and potential savings before going all-in on transformation.

To experience the full "8-Month Window" post with its intended data visualizations and interactive formatting, please continue reading on the new platform.

## 3. "Read More" Button
*Since Substack doesn't support custom HTML, use their native button tool.*

1.  In the Substack editor, click the **Button** icon in the toolbar (or type `/button`).
2.  **Button Text:** `Read "The 8-Month Window" on John-Ellison.com`
3.  **URL:** `https://john-ellison.com/blog/the-8-month-window`
4.  Select "Custom" or "Primary" style as preferred.

## 4. SEO Configuration (Critical)

**Note:** Substack sometimes hides the "Canonical URL" field for new posts.

### Check if the field exists:
1. Go to your **Post Settings**.
2. Click **SEO Options**.
3. **If you see "Canonical URL":** Paste `https://john-ellison.com/blog/the-8-month-window`. You can post the full article.
4. **If you DO NOT see it:** You **MUST** only post an excerpt (approx. 30-50% of the article) on Substack.
   *   **Why?** If you post the full article without a canonical tag, Substack (DA 90+) will likely outrank your new site.
   *   **The Fix:** By posting only the first half and using the "Read More" button, you force Google to index your site for the complete content. This is the "Excerpt Strategy" and it is safer than reposting the whole thing without a canonical tag.
