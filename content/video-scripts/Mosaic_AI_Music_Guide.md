# Mosaic AI Music Guide: AI Transformation

This guide defines the standard inputs for the **Mosaic AI Music Tile**. Music is the emotional "glue" of the video; it must feel expensive, cinematic, and intentional—never generic "background music."

Use these settings to generate a custom score that aligns with the "Moody Premium" and "Interstellar" brand aesthetic.

## 🎹 Core Settings Strategy

*   **Intelligent Video Analysis**: `ON` (Allowed, but **Override** the text inputs below).
*   **Genre/Mood**: **Always set manually.** "Auto-detect" often defaults to generic "Corporate Upbeat" which kills the vibe.
*   **BPM**: Lower is usually better (60-90) for our majestic/serious tone.

## 🎼 Master Prompts by Section

Choose the "Vibe" that aligns with the specific video segment you are processing.

### 1. The "Vision" (Intro / Philosophy / The 8-Month Window)
*   **The Vibe**: "Interstellar", Awe, Vastness, Deep Time.
*   **Prompt**:
    > "Cinematic sci-fi score, Hans Zimmer style, Interstellar vibes. Ethereal wide synth pads, magnificent deep cello swells, slow building tension. Sense of awe, discovery, and vast scale. No percussion."
*   **Genre**: `Cinematic` or `Ambient`
*   **Mood**: `Inspirational` or `Mysterious`
*   **Intensity**: `Medium` (Authorized weight)
*   **BPM**: `60` (Slow and heavy)

### 2. The "Problem" (Market Friction / Stuck / Chaos)
*   **The Vibe**: "Social Network", Tension, Ticking Clock, Anxiety.
*   **Prompt**:
    > "Tense modern investigative score. Minimalist pizzicato strings, low ticking clock rhythm, subtle dissonance. Uneasy, serious, analytical. Digital glitch textures in the background."
*   **Genre**: `Modern Classical` or `Electronic`
*   **Mood**: `Suspenseful` or `Serious`
*   **Intensity**: `Low` (Simmering tension, leaves room for voiceover)
*   **BPM**: `120` (Fast pulse, but quiet mix)

### 3. The "Solution" (Flow / Adoption / Momentum)
*   **The Vibe**: "Organized", Flow State, Warm, Propulsive.
*   **Prompt**:
    > "Propulsive, optimistic organic electronica. Warm analog synths, rhythmic marimba patterns, driving but subtle beat. Flow state, clarity, productivity, solving the puzzle. Tycho or Bonobo style."
*   **Genre**: `Electronica` or `Downtempo`
*   **Mood**: `Focus` or `Optimistic`
*   **Intensity**: `High` (Driving energy)
*   **BPM**: `110` (Active walking pace)

## 🎛️ Manual Overrides (Dropdowns)

If the prompt isn't hitting right, force these dropdown settings:

*   **Genre**:
    *   ✅ **YES**: `Cinematic`, `Ambient`, `Electronic`, `Modern Classical`.
    *   ❌ **NO**: `Corporate`, `Pop`, `Rock`, `Acoustic`, `Lofi Hip Hop` (Too casual).

*   **Mood**:
    *   ✅ **YES**: `Inspirational`, `Focus`, `Dramatic`, `Dark`.
    *   ❌ **NO**: `Happy`, `Quirky`, `Upbeat`, `Party`.

*   **Intensity**:
    *   Use **Low** when John is speaking complex ideas (Voiceover priority).
    *   Use **High** only for visual montages/transitions (Visual priority).

## 🧠 "Negative Prompt" (Mental Check)
Mosaic doesn't have a negative constraint box for music, but ensure you **NEVER** use these words in your prompt:
*   "Upbeat", "Ukulele", "Clapping", "Whistling", "Corporate", "Royalty Free", "Podcast Intro", "Dubstep", "Trap".
