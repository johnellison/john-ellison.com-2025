# Mosaic Motion Graphics Guide: AI Transformation

This guide defines the standard inputs for the **Mosaic Motion Graphics Tile** to ensure all generated overlays and animations align with the "Moody Premium" and "Regenerative" aesthetics of the AI Transformation ecosystem.

Use these settings to prevent generic, "YouTuber-style" pop-ups and ensure an enterprise-grade, cinematic finish.

## ⚙️ Core Tile Settings

### 1. "What kind of motion graphics would you like?" (The Prompt)

Do not use simple prompts like "cool graphics." Use this **Master Prompt** structure to force the AI into our style guidelines:

> **Master Prompt:**
> "Create premium, cinematic **documentary-style** motion graphics.
> **Aesthetic:** Minimalist, high-end 'Vox-style' data visualizations.
> **Color Palette:** Strictly strictly monochrome (White/Black) with **Electric Blue (#4F46E5)** and **Teal** accents for data points.
> **Typography:** Clean Sans-Serif (Inter/Helvetica style), high contrast.
> **Graphic Types:**
> 1. **Lower Thirds:** Clean, frosted glass or deep charcoal backgrounds for speaker names (e.g., 'John Ellison - AI Transformation Expert').
> 2. **Data Overlays:** Line graphs and bar charts floating in 3D space during 'Market' sections.
> 3. **Kinetic Typography:** Highlight key phrases ('8-Month Window', 'Governance', 'ROI') in center-screen, large impactful text.
> **Negative Constraints:** NO cartoons, NO emojis, NO bouncy 'retention editing' styles, NO bright red/yellow primary colors. Keep it serious, authoritative, and elegant."

### 2. Checkbox: "Only generate full screen graphics"
*   **Default:** `Unchecked` (We want overlays on top of the VEO video).
*   **Exception:** Check this `ON` if the video is purely a voiceover with no background footage, forcing Mosaic to create a full visual story.

### 3. Reference Links (Optional)
Always provide the source of truth to ensure the AI pulls accurate terminology and context.
*   **Primary:** `https://john-ellison.com/ai-transformation`
*   **Secondary (If narrative focused):** `https://john-ellison.com/blog/the-8-month-window`

### 4. Style Reference Video (Optional)
Use a consistent YouTube reference that matches the "Intellectual/Documentary" vibe.
*   **Recommended Reference:** `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-6209j4d58` (Example: Search for a specific Vox or Johnny Harris "Map" video that uses the dark/clean aesthetic, or use a previous JE Show clip).
    *   *Note: If you don't have a specific URL, leave blank and rely on the robust Master Prompt above.*

## 🎨 Graphic Types by Section

When refining the prompt for specific video sections, stick to these archetypes:

### The "Problem" Section (Hipster/Friction)
*   **Prompt Modification:** "Focus on **kinetic typography** and **highlighted document text**. Show 'pain points' as checklist items appearing on screen. Use a 'paper texture' background effect if generating full screens."

### The "Solution" Section (Moody Premium)
*   **Prompt Modification:** "Focus on **clean UI overlays**. Simulate 'floating dashboards' and 'efficiency metrics' (green arrows up, costs down). Use subtle **glassmorphism** (blur) behind text to ensure readability against dark backgrounds."

### The "Concept" Section (Regenerative Abstract)
*   **Prompt Modification:** "Use **organic data visualization**. Flowing lines, connecting nodes (network graphs), and circular 'ecosystem' diagrams. extensive use of the **Electric Blue** and **Purple** distinct brand colors."
