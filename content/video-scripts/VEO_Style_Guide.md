# VEO 3.1 AI Video Style Guide: AI Transformation

This guide defines the standard prompt structures and aesthetic parameters for generating video assets using **Google VEO 3.1** (or comparable high-fidelity video models) for the John Ellison AI Transformation ecosystem.

It adapts the static [Image Generation Model] and [AI Transformation Imagery Guidelines] into a motion-first framework to ensure all video content "feels like the website"—premium, cinematic, and authoritative.

## 🎥 Core VEO Constraints

*   **Resolution**: 1080p or 4K (Model Dependent).
*   **Aspect Ratio**: `16:9` (Landscape).
*   **Frame Rate**: `24fps` (Strict cinematic standard—avoid 30/60fps which looks like "soap opera" or cheap stock).
*   **Motion Fidelity**: Prioritize **smoothness** and **coherence** over rapid action.
*   **Negative Prompting**:
    > No morphing, no warping text, no gibberish floating letters, no distorted faces, no "stock footage" waving at camera, no cheesy smiles, no cartoonish effects, no low frame rate, no jitter, no glitching (unless specified).

## 🎬 Universal Prompt Framework

To "break" the generic AI video look, use this structured prompting method for every generation:

1.  **SCENE**: One sentence summary of action.
2.  **VISUALS**: Lighting, texture, color palette (The "Look").
3.  **CAMERA**: Movement, lens choice, angle (The "Feel").
4.  **ATMOSPHERE**: Mood, haze, particle density.

## 🎨 Style 1: Abstract Transformation (Primary for Intros/Concepts)

*Adapts "Abstract High-Concept" for motion. Use for "The 8-Month Window", "Regenerative Wisdom", and high-level strategy.*

*   **Motion Theory**: Fluid, evolving, merging. Things should *grow* or *flow*, not just sit there.
*   **Color Palette**: Deep charcoal background, bioluminescent **Electric Blue**, **Deep Purple**, and **Regenerative Green**.

### Master Prompt Template
> **SCENE**: Abstract visualization of [CONCEPT, e.g., data streams merging into a tree].
> **VISUALS**: High-fidelity digital art, organic patterns made of glowing light fibers, deep charcoal background with bioluminescent [COLOR] accents.
> **CAMERA**: Slow, majestic fly-through or push-in. Smooth, floating camera movement. Macro details evolving into macro structures.
> **ATMOSPHERE**: Ethereal, mystical but technological, shallow depth of field, tiny floating light particles.

### Example: "The Unified System"
> **SCENE**: A fractured mechanical system seamlessly reassembling itself into a glowing perfection.
> **VISUALS**: Metallic shards floating in a void, glowing with electric blue edges, slowly magnetizing toward a center core to form a perfect, pulsing sphere of light. Deep charcoal void.
> **CAMERA**: Slow rotational orbit (dolly arc), focusing on the moment of connection.
> **ATMOSPHERE**: Cinematic, precision, high-tech, 24fps.

## 💼 Style 2: Moody Premium (Enterprise/Governance)

*Adapts "Moody Premium" for motion. Use for "The Market", "Governance", "Security", and "Enterprise" topics.*

*   **Motion Theory**: Heavy, stable, deliberate. Slow pans, subtle rack focus (changing focus from foreground to background). **NO shaky cam.**
*   **Color Palette**: Deep charcoal, subtle **Cyan** & **Violet** rim lights. Cold but expensive.

### Master Prompt Template
> **SCENE**: Cinematic documentary shot of [SUBJECT, e.g., a modern boardroom strategy session].
> **VISUALS**: Dimly lit modern office, glass walls, reflections. Deep charcoal shadows. Subjects are serious, focused, wearing smart-casual/premium attire.
> **CAMERA**: Static tripod shot with shallow depth of field. Subtle rack focus from a foreground object (e.g., a pen, a blurred screen) to the person speaking.
> **ATMOSPHERE**: Serious, heavy, "Succession" style, atmospheric haze, premium film grain.

### Example: "Governance Clarity"
> **SCENE**: A serious review of a security dashboard in a glass-walled conference room.
> **VISUALS**: Close up of a diverse professional pointing at a large screen (screen is blurred/abstract generic UI). Deep charcoal suit, serious expression. Reflection of the data streams in the glass table.
> **CAMERA**: Slow, confident dolly in. Very subtle.
> **ATMOSPHERE**: High-stakes business, quiet authority, cinematic lighting with cyan rim light.

## ☕ Style 3: Hipster Startup (Culture/Friction)

*Adapts "Hipster Startup SF Vibe" for motion. Use for "The Problem", "Internal Friction", and "Human Adoption".*

*   **Motion Theory**: Handheld, documentary, "The Office" (UK) but prettier. Slight breathe/sway in the camera. Authentic human micro-movements (nervous tapping, sighing, leaning back).
*   **Color Palette**: Warm daylight, office plants, wood tones, **Teal** accents.

### Master Prompt Template
> **SCENE**: Candid documentary moment of [SUBJECT, e.g., a team struggling with a new tool].
> **VISUALS**: Bright modern startup office, natural sunlight, plants in background. Messy desks (coffee cups, sticky notes). Subjects look tired, confused, or skeptically discussing.
> **CAMERA**: Handheld aesthetic (slight jitter/sway), looking over someone's shoulder (OTS).
> **ATMOSPHERE**: Authentic, raw, "Mission District" startup vibe, relatable frustration.

### Example: "Internal Resistance"
> **SCENE**: A team member rolling their eyes and leaning back in a chair during a meeting.
> **VISUALS**: Startup office, sun flare through window. Person crosses arms, looking skeptical at a whiteboard. Colleague in background trying to explain.
> **CAMERA**: Handheld medium shot, slight drift.
> **ATMOSPHERE**: Tension, burnout, authentic human friction, warm tones but stressed mood.

## 📽️ Specific Use-Case Prompts (Ready to Run)

### 1. The "8-Month Window" (Urgency)
> **SCENE**: An hourglass made of digital glass, sand flowing upward against gravity.
> **VISUALS**: The "sand" is glowing code/data particles. The glass is hyper-realistic. Dark background with purple ambient glow.
> **CAMERA**: Macro close-up on the neck of the hourglass, slow tilt up to follow the rising particles.
> **ATMOSPHERE**: Surrealistic, urgent, time bending, 24fps cinematic.

### 2. "Legacy Consulting" (The Villain)
> **SCENE**: a dusty stack of heavy binders sitting on an empty mahogany boardroom table.
> **VISUALS**: Old world luxury, but dead. Dust motes dancing in a single shaft of cold light. No people.
> **CAMERA**: Slow, creeping push-in towards the binders.
> **ATMOSPHERE**: Stagnant, silence, weight, outdated.

### 3. "Vibe Coding" (The Flow)
> **SCENE**: A coder's hands moving rhythmically across a backlit mechanical keyboard, but the screen is emitting a "flow" of liquid light instead of text.
> **VISUALS**: Dark room, monitor glow illuminating the face (side profile). The light from the screen changes color—shifting from deep blue to magenta.
> **CAMERA**: Side profile close-up, rack focus from hands to the reflection in their eye.
> **ATMOSPHERE**: Flow state, immersion, speed, "The Social Network" hacking scene vibe.

## 🔊 Sound Design Notes (For Reference)

While VEO generates video, keep the implied audio in mind for editing:
*   **Abstract**: Deep synth drones, swelling orchestral swells, "blip" data noises.
*   **Moody Premium**: Silence, room tone, high-fidelity foley (pen click, leather chair creak).
*   **Hipster Startup**: Office murmur, coffee machine whir, distant sirens, lo-fi beats.
